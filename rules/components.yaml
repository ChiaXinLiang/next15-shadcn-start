description: Rules for React and shadcn components
pattern: src/components/**/*.tsx
conventions:
  - Place reusable components in components/common/
  - shadcn components should be in components/ui/
  - Custom components should be in components/[feature]/
  - Use PascalCase for component names
  - Each component should be in its own file
  - Include type definitions using TypeScript interfaces
implementation:
  structure: |
    src/
      components/
        common/          # Shared components
          Button.tsx
          Card.tsx
        ui/             # shadcn components
          button.tsx
          card.tsx
        features/       # Feature-specific components
          auth/
            LoginForm.tsx
          dashboard/
            Overview.tsx
best_practices:
  - Avoid using `ssr: false` with `next/dynamic` in Server Components
  - Support for ESLint 9
  - Implement Core Web Vitals optimizations
  - Support for both Client and Server Components rendering
